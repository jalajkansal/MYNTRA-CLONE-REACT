🛍️ Myntra Clone (React)

This is a simple React project where I tried to recreate some basic pages and features of the Myntra shopping website.
It includes product listing, product details, and a working cart.
I made this project mainly to practice React, styling, and how e-commerce UI works.

⭐ What this project can do

Shows a list of products

Opens a product details page when you click a product

Lets you add items to the cart

Lets you remove items from the cart

Works on mobile and desktop

Clean and simple design inspired by Myntra

🔧 Tech I used

React

React Router for navigation

CSS for styling

JavaScript (ES6)

Nothing too complex — just straightforward React practice.

📁 Project overview

The project is divided into:

components – small UI pieces

pages – main screens like Home, Product Page, Cart

assets – images, icons, etc.

context / state – (if used) for sharing data like cart items

Very simple and easy to follow.

📌 Why I built this

I created this project to:

improve my React skills

understand how shopping websites structure their UI

practice routing, props, state, and reusable components

This was mainly a learning project.

🚀 Future ideas

If I continue working on it, I might add:
